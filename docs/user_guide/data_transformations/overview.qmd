Data transformations are operations we perform on one kind of data that result in another kind of data.

Transformations supported by Neuralyzer are listed below:

### Analog Time Series

#### Event Detection by Threshold Crossing

Generate events from a time series by comparing signal to some threshold value.

**Threshold Value:**

The numerical level the signal must cross to be considered an event. The signal will be compared directly against this value based on the selected direction.

**Threshold Direction:**

How the signal must cross the **Threshold Value** to trigger an event:

-   **Positive (Rising):** Detects an event only when the signal value increases and crosses above the **Threshold Value**.

-   **Negative (Falling):** Detects an event only when the signal value decreases and crosses below the **Threshold Value**.

-   **Absolute (Magnitude):** Detects an event when the absolute value of the signal (abs(signal)) rises above the **Threshold Value**. This detects crossings away from zero on either the positive or negative side.

**Lockout Time (Samples):**

The minimum number of samples that must pass after an event is detected before another threshold crossing can trigger a new event. Enter 0 (or less) to disable the lockout, allowing consecutive samples to trigger events if they cross the threshold. This helps prevent multiple detections from a single noisy crossing.

#### Find Peaks

Attempts to find peaks in analog time series (local maxima or minima).

#### Instantaneous Amplitude Calculation

Determine the instantaneous amplitude of an oscillatory time series. uses Hilbert Transform.

#### Instantaneous Phase Calculation

Determine the instantaneous phase of an oscillatory time series. Uses Hilbert Transform.

#### Interval Detection

Determine an interval range where an angle signal is above (or below) a threshold value. Returns the beginning and end of the above/below threshold time period.

**Threshold Value:**

Description: Enter the numerical level the signal must cross to be considered an event. The signal will be compared directly against this value based on the selected direction. The interval will be defined from the first to last sample that are above or below the **Threshold Value**.

**Threshold Direction:**

Description: Select how the signal must cross the **Threshold Value** to trigger an interval:

-   **Positive (Rising):** Detects an interval only when the signal value increases and remains above the **Threshold Value**.

-   **Negative (Falling):** Detects an event only when the signal value decreases and remains below the **Threshold Value**.

-   **Absolute (Magnitude):** Detects an event when the absolute value of the signal (abs(signal)) rises above the **Threshold Value**. This detects crossings away from zero on either the positive or negative side. Once the absolute value is smaller than the abs(signal), the interval has ended.

**Lockout Time (Samples):**

Description: Specify the minimum number of samples that must pass after an interval has ended before another threshold crossing can trigger a new event. Enter 0 (or less) to disable the lockout.

**Minimum Duration (Samples):**

Description: Specify the minimum number of samples that must be in an interval to be included. Threshold crossings with durations shorter than **Minimum Duration** will not be included in result.

### Masks

#### Area

Total area of the mask in a frame is calculated.
