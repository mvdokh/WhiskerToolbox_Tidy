We have a Collapsible Widget called a "Section" available. This kind of widget can expand to display the contents of the widget. This is useful for making an interface appear less cluttered.

General process for to add collapsible Widget:

QT Designer:

1.  Ensure the parent widget is in a vertical layout

2.  Create QWidget inside and promote it to a "Section"

3.  Create another QWidget within that QWidget. The inner QWidget will hold all the contents of the section.

4.  Populate this inner QWidget with widgets as normal.

Code part:

1.  Call `autoSetContentLayout()` on the Section QWidget after `setupUi`.

2.  Optionally, calling `setTitle("title")` will give it a title.
