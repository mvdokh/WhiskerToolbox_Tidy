## Data Types

### Point

A Point represents a 2 dimensional (x, y) coordinate, which may vary in time. The `PointData` structure can hold multiple points per unit time.

| Examples of Point Data |
|------------------------|
|                        |
|                        |
|                        |

### Line

A Line represents a 2 dimensional (x,y) collection of points, which may vary with time. The collection of points is **ordered**, meaning that each point is positioned relative to its neighbors. The `LineData` structure can hold multiple lines per unit time.

| Examples of Line Data |
|-----------------------|
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |

### Mask

A mask represents a 2 dimensional collection of points, which may vary with time. Compared to a Line, the points in a Mask are not **ordered**. These would correspond to something like a binary segmentation mask over an image. The `MaskData` structure can hold multiple masks per unit time.

| Examples of Mask Data               |
|-------------------------------------|
| Binary Semantic Segmentation Labels |
|                                     |
|                                     |

### Tensors

Tensors are N-Dimensional data structures, and consequently very flexible containers for complex data. A concrete use would be to store a Height x Width x Channel array for different timepoints during an experiment. These may be the features output from an encoder neural network that processes a video.

| Examples of Tensor Data |
|-------------------------|
|                         |
|                         |
|                         |

### Analog Time Series

An analog time series has values that can vary continuously

| Examples of Analog Time Series Data                |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| Voltage traces from electrode recordings           |
| Fluorescence intensity traces from Calcium imaging |
|                                                    |

### Digital Event Series

A digital event represents an ordered sequence of events, where each event is represented as a single instance in time. For instance, spike times from electrophysiology

| Examples of Event Data |
|------------------------|
|                        |
|                        |
|                        |

### Digital Interval Series

| Examples of Interval Data |
|---------------------------|
|                           |
|                           |
|                           |

### Media

Media is a sequence of images.

|                                                           |

#### Video

|---------------------------------------------------------|
| MP4 video from high speed scientific camera of behavior |
|                                                         |
|                                                         |
