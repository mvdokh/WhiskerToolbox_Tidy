The objected intended to be masked should be completely within this rectangle. If a mistake is made the reset button returns the tool to the initial state.\nThe GrabCut algorithm works as such: the algorithm keeps track of the mask and for each iteration, attempts to refine it. In between iterations, the user can tweak the mask to provide feedback to the algorithm, which will be noted through subsequent iterations.\nAfter drawing an ROI the “Iterate Grabcut” button becomes functional. Using it completes one iteration of the GrabCut algorithm. The first usage of this button will show the initial mask created by the algorithm. Ideally the user should press this button throughout the editing process.\n\nOpacity of the displayed mask can be adjusted with the transparency slider\n\n\n\nUser Feedback\nIn between iterations the user has access to a drawing bush whose radius can be adjusted. It is used to paint feedback for the GrabCut algorithm, which it will take into account upon pressing the “Iterate Grabcut” button. The brush has four colors:\n\n“Definite Background”: Tells GrabCut the painted area is definitely not part of the mask.\n“Definite Foreground”: Tells GrabCut the painted area is definitely part of the mask.\n“Probable Background”: Suggests to GrabCut the painted area may not be part of the mask. GrabCut uses this information to create a better mask but may partially/fully disobey it.\n“Probable Foreground”: Suggests to GrabCut the painted area is likely part of the mask. GrabCut uses this information to create a better mask but may partially/fully disobey it.\n\n\n\nSaving and Exporting\nThe GrabCut tool may be exited at any time by pressing the “Exit” button. “Save and Exit” will exit the tool and save the mask into the main application and displayed in the media player. All created masks can be saved to disk using the “Save Drawn Masks” button in the Tongue Tracking widget."

The signal will be compared directly against this value based on the selected direction.\nThreshold Direction:\nHow the signal must cross the Threshold Value to trigger an event:\n\nPositive (Rising): Detects an event only when the signal value increases and crosses above the Threshold Value.\nNegative (Falling): Detects an event only when the signal value decreases and crosses below the Threshold Value.\nAbsolute (Magnitude): Detects an event when the absolute value of the signal (abs(signal)) rises above the Threshold Value. This detects crossings away from zero on either the positive or negative side.\n\nLockout Time (Samples):\nThe minimum number of samples that must pass after an event is detected before another threshold crossing can trigger a new event. Enter 0 (or less) to disable the lockout, allowing consecutive samples to trigger events if they cross the threshold. This helps prevent multiple detections from a single noisy crossing.\n\n\nFind Peaks\nAttempts to find peaks in analog time series (local maxima or minima).\n\n\nInstantaneous Amplitude Calculation\nDetermine the instantaneous amplitude of an oscillatory time series. uses Hilbert Transform.\n\n\nInstantaneous Phase Calculation\nDetermine the instantaneous phase of an oscillatory time series. Uses Hilbert Transform.\n\n\nInterval Detection\nDetermine an interval range where an angle signal is above (or below) a threshold value. Returns the beginning and end of the above/below threshold time period.\nThreshold Value:\nDescription: Enter the numerical level the signal must cross to be considered an event. The signal will be compared directly against this value based on the selected direction. The interval will be defined from the first to last sample that are above or below the Threshold Value.\nThreshold Direction:\nDescription: Select how the signal must cross the Threshold Value to trigger an interval:\n\nPositive (Rising): Detects an interval only when the signal value increases and remains above the Threshold Value.\nNegative (Falling): Detects an event only when the signal value decreases and remains below the Threshold Value.\nAbsolute (Magnitude): Detects an event when the absolute value of the signal (abs(signal)) rises above the Threshold Value. This detects crossings away from zero on either the positive or negative side. Once the absolute value is smaller than the abs(signal), the interval has ended.\n\nLockout Time (Samples):\nDescription: Specify the minimum number of samples that must pass after an interval has ended before another threshold crossing can trigger a new event. Enter 0 (or less) to disable the lockout.\nMinimum Duration (Samples):\nDescription: Specify the minimum number of samples that must be in an interval to be included. Threshold crossings with durations shorter than Minimum Duration will not be included in result.\n\n\n\nMasks\n\nArea\nTotal area of the mask in a frame is calculated.",

This can be useful for semi-automated annotation of datasets, where the user labels some training data, and then predicts the remaining unlabeled frames. Then annotations can then be easily compared with the video data.",
