(\^ this should be a gif)

This tutorial will show you how to add, review, and change key points located on frames throughout a video.

![](2.png)

Load the video that you intend to label. Or, select Load JSON configuration if you have generated a key point .csv and would like to review the labels. (See: setting up a JSON file)

![](3.png)

Open the data manager to create a new point feature

![](4.png)

Set the output directory for your key point-coordinate containing .csv file

Create a new point feature with the type: point

Time frame should correspond to (x)

Name the point after the feature that you will be labeling

![](5.png)

Enable the feature in the media widget to open the point editor\
Change the color and opacity (Alpha) to ensure visibility

Change the size and shape of the key point if needed

Choose "select point" under mouse mode to begin adding points

NOTE: the key point will always be represented by a single pixel and the marker shape information will not be retained

To add points, click anywhere in the media canvas to add a point. If a point already exists in the frame, the point will be moved.

Once labeling is finished, labeled frames and the feature coordinates will appear in the data manager when the new feature is selected.

From here, the export selections can be made.

The delimiter will specify the separations between each column

The line ending will specify the separations made between each line

This text formatting information is useful for subsequent data analysis

By checking the "Export matching media frames" box, a new folder will be created in the output folder that will contain images of the frames that contain key points.

NOTE: the key points will not be overlaid on the frame

Once done, click "Save to CSV"

If successful, your screen should look like this, and the key point data should be saved to the output folder defined earlier.
